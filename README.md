An impressive and immersive "gamified" personal development application, the "Shadow Monarch System" draws thematic inspiration from the popular Korean webtoon Solo Leveling.[1][2] The app allows users to "level up" in their own lives by earning experience points (XP) for completing real-world tasks.

At its core, the application is a personal leveling system where users can track their progress by completing a variety of predefined and custom activities. These range from daily habits like personal hygiene and meals to more challenging endeavors such as studying or coding. Each completed activity rewards the user with a set amount of XP, contributing to their overall level progression. The system is designed to be reminiscent of a role-playing game, where characters advance and grow stronger over time.

The visual design and user interface are heavily influenced by the dark and mystical aesthetic of "Solo Leveling," a manhwa (Korean comic) that tells the story of a weak hunter who gains the ability to level up his powers.[1][2][3] This thematic choice is evident in the app's color scheme, font selection, and the "system notification" style messages.

Key features of the application include:

User Authentication and Data Persistence: The app utilizes Firebase for user authentication, allowing users to create accounts and have their progress, including their current level, XP, and activity logs, securely saved.

Dynamic Leveling System: The XP required to advance to the next level increases as the user's level rises, providing a continuous sense of challenge and accomplishment.

Predefined and Custom Activities: Users can choose from a list of pre-loaded activities with set XP values or create their own custom tasks tailored to their personal goals.

AI-Powered Motivation: A unique feature is the integration of the Gemini API to generate motivational messages upon leveling up and to suggest personalized "daily quests."

Real-time Activity Logging: The application provides a log of recently completed activities, offering users a tangible record of their accomplishments.

Engaging User Interface: The app features a visually appealing and interactive interface with progress bars, modals for important notifications, and a responsive design suitable for various screen sizes.

The "Shadow Monarch System" is a creative and engaging tool for personal growth, effectively blending the appeal of gamification with a popular cultural theme to motivate users on their self-improvement journey.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
